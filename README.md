### Sup people üëã

I'm a programming enthusiast with an insatiable hunger for learning. ‚ù§Ô∏è I kick-started my journey with C++, which paved my way to the mesmerizing world of web technologies.

Currently, I'm a professional diving deep into e-commerce, harnessing the power of Symfony, Vue, and React.

When I'm on a personal coding spree, you'll find me getting cozy with TypeScript üòç. But what truly excites me is experimenting with a plethora of frameworks and embarking on diverse projects.

## Tech stack and favorites

```typescript
export const favorites: Record<'languages' | 'frameworks' | 'technologies', string[]> = {
    languages: [ 'C++', 'Python', 'TypeScript', 'HTML', 'CSS', 'PHP' ],
    frameworks: [ 'Stacks', 'Next', 'Nuxt', 'Symfony', 'Flask', 'tailwind' ],
    technologies: [ 'Docker', 'Git', 'JetBrains', 'VSCode' ],
}
```

The above are just a few of my go-to tools and languages. I've had the pleasure of working with and exploring many more. Always curious, always learning. üå±
