### Sup people üëã

I'm a programming enthusiast with an insatiable hunger for learning. ‚ù§Ô∏è I kick-started my journey with C++, which paved my way to the mesmerizing world of web technologies.

Currently, I'm a professional diving deep into e-commerce, harnessing the power of Symfony, Vue, and React.

When I'm on a personal coding spree, you'll find me getting cozy with TypeScript üòç. But what truly excites me is experimenting with a plethora of frameworks and embarking on diverse projects.

## Tech stack and favorites

```typescript
export const favorites: Record<'languages' | 'frameworks' | 'others', string[]> = {
    languages: [ 'C++', 'python', 'typescript', 'html/css', 'php' ],
    frameworks: [ 'stacks', 'next', 'nuxt', 'symfony', 'flask' ],
    others: [ 'docker', 'git', 'jetbrains', 'vscode' ],
}
```
