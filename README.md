### Sup people 👋

Currently, I'm a professional diving deep into e-commerce, harnessing the power of Symfony, Vue, and React. On a personal coding spree, however, you'll find me getting cozy with TypeScript 😍.

```typescript
export const favorites: Record<'languages' | 'frameworks' | 'tools', string[]> = {
    languages: [ 'C++', 'Python', 'TypeScript', 'HTML', 'CSS', 'PHP' ],
    frameworks: [ 'Stacks', 'Next', 'Nuxt', 'Symfony', 'Flask', 'tailwind' ],
    tools: [ 'Docker', 'Git', 'JetBrains', 'VSCode' ],
}
```

The above are just a few of my go-to tools and languages. I've had the pleasure of working with and exploring many more.

Always curious, always learning. 🌱
